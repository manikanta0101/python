# python program for smallest among three numbers take input from the user
n1=int(input("enter the first number:"))
n2=int(input("enter the second number:"))
n3=int(input("enter the third number:"))
if n1<=n2 and n1<=n3:
    print("smallest number = ",n1)
elif n2<=n1 and n2<=n3:
    print("smallest number = ",n2)
else:
    print("smallest number = ",n3)

output:
enter the first number:3
enter the second number:4
enter the third number:5
smallest number =  3
