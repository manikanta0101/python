temp=first
first=second
second=temp
print("after swapping first number = ",first)
print("after swapping second number = ",second)

output:
enter the first number:3
enter the second number:4
before swapping first number =  3
before swapping second number =  4
after swapping first number =  4
after swapping second number =  3
